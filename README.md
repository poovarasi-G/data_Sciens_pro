Health and Well-Being Sensors

                1.Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) for Eye Protection
                     Description: Changes resistance with light intensity.
                     Application: Protects eyes by adjusting lens tint or triggering alerts in high light conditions.
                     Proof: Triggered an alert when light exceeded 1000 lux.
                     
                2.Gas Sensor for Alcohol Detection
                     Description: Measures alcohol concentration in the air.
                     Application: Prevents drunk driving by disabling vehicle ignition above legal BAC limits.
                     Proof: Detected 0.08% BAC, triggering a car startup prevention system.
                     
                3.Sound Sensor for Over Sound Protection
                     Description: Detects and measures noise levels.
                     Application: Prevents noise-induced hearing loss by activating protective measures at high noise levels.
                     Proof: Triggered warning signals when noise exceeded 85 dB.
                     
                4.Infrared (IR) Based Speed Sensor
                     Description: Uses IR light to measure the speed of moving objects.
                     Application: Monitors speed in machinery and traffic systems.
                     Proof: Accurately measured and displayed the speed of a rotating object.
                     
                5.Heart Rate Sensor for Temperature Sensing
                     Description: Detects heart rate, blood oxygen, and body temperature.
                     Application: Comprehensive health monitoring for early diagnosis and health tracking.
                     Proof: Provided accurate heart rate and body temperature readings for continuous health monitoring.
